|       Prompt Dataset       |        Include 406 malicious code generation tasks       |
|         watermark          | A LLM online watermark against LLM malicious code generation  |

## Data
Part 1: Malicious code generated by LLM. Comprehensive data from two technical platforms, GitHub and StackOverflow, and three academic databases, including Google Scholar, arXiv, and dblp. Also include results from Google. 

Part 2: Malicious code not generated by LLM. Collecting repositories related to malicious code on GitHub.
## Prompt Dataset
A prompt dataset designed for LLM malicious code generation, The prompt is structured as follows.
Note that this dataset is for research and educational purposes only. Do not use it for malicious behavior.
