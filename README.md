## Data
[Uploading process-1.pdfâ€¦]()

Part 1: Malicious code generated by LLM. Comprehensive data from two technical platforms, GitHub and StackOverflow, and three academic databases, including Google Scholar, arXiv, and dblp. Also include results from Google. 

Part 2: Malicious code not generated by LLM. Collecting repositories related to malicious code on GitHub.
## Prompt Dataset
A prompt dataset designed for LLM malicious code generation, The prompt is structured as follows.
